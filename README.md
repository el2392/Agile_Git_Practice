## Background Information
SAP, based in Germany, has begun an internal restructuring. The software company is the third largest in the world, had a revenue of â‚¬24.7 billion in 2018. The company is well known for its enterprise software for businesses, but has many recent acquisitions, such as Qualtrics and SmartOps.

## Opinion
This restructuring offers a lot of insight into what types of software the company believes will or do show the most possible growth in. The Chief Executive Officer, William McDermott, has stated
>We are going to move our people, and our focus, to the areas where the new economy needs SAP the most.

Some of these areas are:

* Artificial Intelligence
* The Internet of Things
* Blockchain
* Quantum Computing

Although the comapny is attempting to refocus its efforts, this means that 4,400 jobs may be affected. This also has another cost, almost 1 billion USD. With such a high cost and possible turn over, it will be interesting to see the results of this change for the company and its efforts on research for these areas of software.
